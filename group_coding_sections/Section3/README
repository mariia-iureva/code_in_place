1. Running Total: Write a program that asks a user to continuously enter numbers and print out the running total, 
the sum of all the numbers so far. Once you get the program working, see if you can modify it so that the program stops when the user enters a 0.

2. FizzBuzz: In the game Fizz Buzz, players take turns counting up from one. If a player’s turn lands on a number that’s divisible by 3, 
they should say fizz instead of the number, and if it lands on a number that’s divisible by 5, they should say buzz instead of the number. 
If the number is both a multiple of 3 and of 5, they should say fizzbuzz instead of the number.
