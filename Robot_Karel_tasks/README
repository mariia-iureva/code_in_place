This is set of exercises where we use special "world" with little robot Karel and we need to make him move and do tasks with simple commands. 
he knows only move(), turn_left(), put_beeper() and take_beeper()
and there also some conditions that he understands like if_beeper_present() or if_front_is_clear.
On the first lesson in Code In Place we were constructing helper functions from this very limited set of commands.
